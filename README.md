madedit-mod
===========

MadEdit Mod(based on the madedit project @ sourceforge)

Based on [madedit@sf](https://sourceforge.net/projects/madedit/). Patched a lot from the contributors because the author is not active any more. The patches includes bug fixing from contributors of Madedit and some bloody edge enhancement. Madedit is one of the best free editor I ever know. See detailed introduction at it homepage. I create this page just for those user who need these features but are not able to build from source code by themselves. Use GPL because the author does.

You're encouraged to translate MadEdit-Mod into your native language if there's not already a translation.

NOTE:

The release marked as Selfuse is a bloody edge and buggy one with a lot of enhancement without carefully tested(Eg. Drag and Drop(cross-platform), bookmark, etc). Try it at your own risk. From 2.9.1, the implementation of single instance has to be changed and not compatible with 2.8.x, which means madedit.exe could not behave correctly if another madedit.exe(complied with wxwidgets 2.8.x) were running.
